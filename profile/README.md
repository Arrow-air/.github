Current transportation infrastructure is radically suboptimal for such a distributed population. Roads and current commercial air travel are far too indirect to be practical ðŸ˜¤. We need a point-to-point way of travel that is **easy and affordable** for everyone. Arrow is a decentralized community building vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) aircraft and rideshare protocols to bring personal air travel to everyone.


### ðŸ¦„ Web3 Native
Thanks to blockchain technology, Arrow's business logic lives on the Ethereum blockchain âœ¨. Being web3-native allows us to appreciate contributors with a mix of stablecoins and ARROW tokens ðŸ’°, irrespective of where they came from! 

The transparent nature of the web3 world means that we are completely open-source! Yes, even for hardware projects! We believe an open community will build a larger "brain trust" ðŸ§  than any company building in secret could have.
