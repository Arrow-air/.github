# 👋 Welcome!

Current transportation infrastructure is radically suboptimal for a distributed population. Roads and current commercial air travel are far too indirect to be practical. We need a point-to-point way of travel that is **easy and affordable** for everyone. 

Arrow is a decentralized community building vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) aircraft and rideshare protocols to bring personal air travel to everyone.


### 🦄 Web3 Native
Thanks to blockchain technology, Arrow's business logic lives on the Ethereum blockchain ✨. Being web3-native allows us to appreciate contributors with a mix of stablecoins and ARROW tokens 💰, irrespective of where they came from! 

The transparent nature of the web3 world means that we are completely open-source! Yes, even for hardware projects! We believe an open community will build a larger "brain trust" 🧠 than any company building in secret could have.
