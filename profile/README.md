# 👋 Welcome to Arrow

<img src="/profile/assets/arrow_v2_twitter-banner_neu.png">

**Arrow is proving open source hardware works for aircraft.** Our first platform, Project Quiver, has 12 dev-kits deployed worldwide—every design file, from mechanical CAD to PCB schematics, fully open.

**Mission:** Increase physical connectedness to the people and places you love.

## 🚁 Project Quiver

Our flagship project is an open-source multipurpose quadcopter platform designed for reliability, modularity, and real-world use.

| Spec | Value |
|------|-------|
| Max Takeoff Weight | 25 kg |
| Payload Capacity | 5-8 kg |
| Hover Endurance | 25-31 minutes |
| Flight Controller | ArduPilot (Pix32 V6) |
| Attachment Interfaces | 3 (bottom, left, right) |

**Dev-kits are available for loan** — build attachments, test integrations, contribute to the ecosystem.

📦 **[project-quiver](https://github.com/Arrow-air/project-quiver)** — CAD files, PCB designs, assembly guides, flight logs

## 🦄 DAO-Native Hardware

Arrow isn't a company—it's a global collective coordinated through Ethereum.

**Why it matters for hardware:**
- **Borderless contributors** — Engineers in Texas, Germany, and beyond collaborate and get paid in stablecoins + $ARROW tokens
- **Radical transparency** — CAD files, PCB designs, flight logs—all open source. Even our governance proposals are public.
- **Decentralized manufacturing** — Community manufacturers worldwide, not a single factory

Governance happens through Arrow Improvement Proposals (AIPs), voted on via [Snapshot](https://snapshot.box/#/s:arrowair.eth) and discussed on our [DAO Forum](https://dao.arrowair.com).

We're proving open source hardware can work like open source software.
