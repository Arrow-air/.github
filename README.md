# Organizational README

This special repo allows for customizing Arrow's Overview page to show "content dedicated to public users or members of the organization. Members of your organization who are signed into GitHub, are shown a member view when they visit your organization's profile page. Users who are not members of your organization will be shown a public view." (source: [GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/collaborating-with-groups-in-organizations/customizing-your-organizations-profile))
